# Platform Initialization

Be sure to read [01-setting-up-new-project.md](01-setting-up-new-project.md) before continuing as this document will make references to it and assuming that the reading is aware of the background as to why platform initialization is required.

Platform initialization is a way for the user to do one time configuration of the hardware and is done by implementing `platform_init()` functions. The initialization could be for example - clock configurations, enabling or disabling certain blocks etc. **If not anything, the user needs to provide a way for shell to put and get a character from some stream (e.g uart). This is Mandatory! And expected!**

`platform_init()` can be implemented at any level but for the reasons of making the source code organization obvious, it's preferred to have a `platform.c` file which implements it. As discussed in [Define platform_init()](01-setting-up-new-project.md#define-platforminit) section we have the following directory structure:

```
new_project
|-- Makefile
└── platform.c
```

With `platform.c` having the following:

```

#include "shell.h"

void platform_init(void) {

}
```

- Our interest is in populating the contents of `pltform_init()`. As hinted earlier the shell needs a way to put and get a character from somewhere so user interaction is possible.
- Typically this would be a `uart` and in certain cases can be `memory`, `mailbox` or some other interface. We assume it is the `uart`.

## The Uart interfaces

The user would need to provide a uart driver that provides the following interfaces:
- `void uart_init(void)` uart initialization.
- `void uart_putc(char c)` a way to send a character out.
- `int uart_getc(void)` a way to read a character in.

More details on the uart driver are discussed in the [03-uart-driver.md](03-uart-driver.md) documentation.

Assuming these implementations to be available through `uart.h` (that the user has separately implemented), the `platform.c` would then look like so -

```

   * User can do other configurations here.
   * E.g clocks, enable/disable blocks
   */

  /* Initialize the UART */
  uart_init();

- we would need to fix this. Create a directory `new_project/uart/` and add two files `uart.c` and `uart.h` in it. (if the user already has a uart driver, then the source should be simply copied to `new_project/` and the expected interfaces as expected above should be provided in `uart.h`).
- the directory structure should look as follows:

```
new_project
|-- Makefile
|-- platform.c
└──  uart
    |-- uart.c
    └── uart.h
```

- put the following in `uart.h`

- Issue `make` in `new_project/` again. Prints similar to following should be seen:

# Next:

- While the compilation is successful. Becuase the uart driver in this case was incomplete (empty functions), the shell would boot but now work as expected.
- [03-uart-driver.md](03-uart-driver.md) discusses more on the uart driver implementation which should be the last step in making the shell completely functional.
