# Setting up new Project

At the root level create a directory `new_project`. The repo should have the following structure. For the purposes of this guide, we set up a from the scratch project in `new_project/` directory.

```
.
├── docs
├── examples
├── LICENSE
├── new_project
├── README.md
└── shell
```

# Setting up the build - Makefile

In the project directory (`new_project/`), create a `Makefile`. The directory tree should look as follows:

```
new_project
└── Makefile
```

Add following to the `new_project/Makefile`

```

# Set the toolchain prefix, something similar to below.
# this example is for RISC-V, For ARM it would be -
# arm-none-eabi- or aarch64-linux-gnu-
TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX = riscv64-linux-gnu-

# This option affects the optimization that the compiler will use
OPTIMIZATION     = 0

# Set the startup file that should be used for compilation.
# This should be a .S file that has the initialization code.
# user can either provide name of a file already available in
# shell/startup/ or give name of a user defined file.
STARTUP    		 = riscv64

# Provide the base of the boot memory
RAM_BASE_PHYSICAL  = 0x80000000

# Provide the size of the memory
RAM_SIZE           = 0x4000000

# Provide the base of the uart on which the shell
# should be available on.
UART_BASE_PHYSICAL = 0x10000000

# If you have your own layout file that should be used by the linker, set this
# variable to point to the layout file.
# USER_LAYOUT_FILE = layout.ld

# DEFINES   += <flags to be passed to compiler>
# ASM_FLAGS += <flags to be passed to the assembler>
# LD_FLAGS  += <flags to be passed to the assembler>

# Set this as 1 to use a lite version of the shell \
# This disables support for the following: \
#   * printf formatting \
#   * long integers in printf \
#   * memory manipulation utilities \
#   * command history in prompt \
# Skip the next 4 defines in this file if using SHELL_LITE
# SHELL_LITE = 1

# Uncomment to use printf() without the formatting support
# DEFINES += -DSHELL_PRINTF_LITE

# Uncomment to use printf() without the long integer
# formatting support. Valid only if SHELL_PRINTF_LITE is not defined
# DEFINES += -DSHELL_NO_PRINTF_LL

# Uncomment to skip compiling the memory manipulation utilities.
# DEFINES += -DSHELL_NO_UTILS

# Uncomment to disable the command history on the prompt
# DEFINES += -DSHELL_NO_HISTORY

# Set this variable to point to the shell directory
SHELL_ROOT=../shell
-include $(SHELL_ROOT)/Makefile

# ------------------------ User targets below this line ------------------------

# example: <dependencies>
#     @recipes
```

## Note
- The comments in the `Makefile` are self explanatory.
- One can also look at the Makefiles as part of the examples implemented in the `examples/` directory.
- The purpose of the project level `Makefile` is to the connect with the shell's `Makefile` (`shell/Makefile`) and use all the magic available there.
  - A study of the `shell/Makefile` should give more insight into how the build process works.
  - The Project level variables steer the build magic to achieve the compilation.

## Try to compile

- Issuing the `make` command should result in the following prints.

```
$ make

```

- The linking phase fails! the linker (`ld`) has reported a missing implementation of `platform_init()`

```

make: *** [../shell/Makefile:156: shell.elf] Error 1
```

# Define platform_init()

- Do get to zero error compilation we would need to define a function `platform_init()`.
- To do so create another file `platform.c` and add the following to it:

```

 **/

#include "shell.h"

void platform_init(void) {

}
```

- At this point the directory structure should be as follows:

```
new_project
|-- Makefile
└── platform.c
```

- Issue `make` again and you should see similar prints as below:

```
$ make

# Next

- **A zero error compilation with project level `Makefile` (as below) doesn't necessarily mean that the binary will boot and the shell would be available on the uart**.
  - for the shell to work correctly it also needs a uart driver. Typically the user has to implement this.
  - the `platform_init()` funciton initializes the `uart` and provides the shell with a means of putting and fetching a character from the UART.
- See [02-platform_init-and-uart-driver.md](02-platform_init-and-uart-driver.md) for details on how to enable shell to be fully functional.
